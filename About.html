    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Given current trends in food quality, it is reasonable to assume that fast food is becoming more casual.
     Fast food is appealing because it is convenient, but it is not beneficial to oneâ€™s health or sense of community. 
     Consumers in the future will be far more appreciative of a more healthily crafted meal. With the rapid advancement of technology, 
    it is reasonable to anticipate that many human interactions in the restaurant industry will be reduced and replaced by advanced programs or even robots.
    Broadly speaking, the restaurant of the upcoming years is capable of transitioning to digital
    ordering and leveraging new restaurant tools to enhance operations and maintenance efficiency.</p>
