    <h1>Contact us</h1>
    <p>Did you know that for many sites, the contact page gets more page views than any other section? It’s true, especially for agencies and contractors.

        While many sites throw up a contact us page as a quick after-thought, you should be dedicating a lot more time and care to your contact page because, for many brands, it’s the beginning of your relationship with potential customers.
        
        Today we’re providing some contact us page best practices and looking at examples of incredible contact us pages that show various styles based on different business audiences and intent.
