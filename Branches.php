    <p>As one of the most competitive business sectors worldwide, the restaurant sector has developed over time and demonstrated drastic expansion.
     Its development started as a primitive facility, restricted in services and products. Nevertheless, nowadays, it has broadened its focus areas,
      taking sustainability, innovations, and other factors into account.
     The trending policies that are currently in vogue will affect the industry in the future, implying its digitalization, staff reduction, and transition to balanced nutrition.</p>

      <p>Given current trends in food quality, it is reasonable to assume that fast food is becoming more casual. Fast food is appealing because it is convenient, but it is not beneficial to oneâ€™s health or sense of community.
         Consumers in the future will be far more appreciative of a more healthily crafted meal.
         With the rapid advancement of technology, it is reasonable to anticipate that many human interactions in the restaurant industry will be reduced and replaced by advanced programs or even robots.
          Broadly speaking, the restaurant of the upcoming years is capable of transitioning to digital ordering and leveraging new restaurant tools to enhance operations and maintenance efficiency.</p>
