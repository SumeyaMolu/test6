    <p>Eating at a chain or fast food restaurant increases the likelihood that a person will overeat because serving sizes are not reasonable. Unfortunately, studies show that portion sizes have increased exponentially in the last few decades, 
        and this is likely contributing to the obesity epidemic (Rannals 1). Restaurants need to cut back on the amount of food they are serving. 
        They also need to be more honest and open with customers about when the portion sizes do exceed recommendations. Restaurantsâ€™ nutrition information often list just one piece of fried chicken or one slice of pizza as a serving size (MacVean 1).
         It is unlikely that customers will limit themselves when given a basket of chicken or an entire pizza. 
        The best solution is just to sell meals in smaller quantities.</p>
